# About this project

This is the first prototype of [YOTA](https://github.com/MatejaMaric/yota-laravel) reservation system,
made in pure PHP, and it uses MariaDB.

**It is a great example of how things should NOT be done.**

It showcases benefits of using a framework and concepts like:

- Routing
- Models, Views, Controllers
- Templating
- Object-relational mapping
- Database migrations

You can of course implement all this by yourself using object-oriented PHP.
But there is little reason to do that since you can use a framework like Laravel that does all that and more, better.
